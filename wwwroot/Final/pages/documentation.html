                    The commands "/config" and "/data" are two slash commands that can be used to configure and
                    manage various features on your Discord server. In this documentation, we'll go over how to use 
                    these commands and their available options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "/config" command allows you to configure different features on your server and set them to specific
                    channels. To use the "/config" command, simply type "/config" followed by the feature you want to configure 
                    and the channel you want to set it to. The syntax for the command is as follows:
                </p>
                <p>/config &LeftAngleBracket;feature&RightAngleBracket; &LeftAngleBracket;channel&RightAngleBracket;</p>
                <p>
                    &LeftAngleBracket;feature&RightAngleBracket; can be one of the following options: "AutoMod", "Filter", or "Welcome".
                </p>
                <p>
                    &LeftAngleBracket;channel&RightAngleBracket; is any Discord channel you want to set the feature to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, to configure AutoMod to the channel #general, you would type: "/config AutoMod #general"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "/config" command supports the following features: AutoMod, Filter, and Welcome. You can choose to set these features to any Discord channel,
                    including text channels and voice channels. Categories can not be utilized by any configuration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The "/data" command allows you to manage your server's data by either getting or deleting it. To use the "/data" command, simply type "/data" followed
                    by the option you want to use. The syntax for the command is as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    &LeftAngleBracket;option&RightAngleBracket; can be one of the following options: "get" or "delete"
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, to get your server's data, you would execute "/data get".
                    To delete your server's data, you would type execute "/data delete".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The slash commands "/config" and "/data" are useful tools for configuring and managing various features on your Discord server. By using these commands,
                    you can ensure that your server is moderated effectively, messages are filtered appropriately, and your server's data is managed properly. If you have any
                    questions or concerns, please reach out to our support team for assistance.
