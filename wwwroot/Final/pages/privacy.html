                    We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
                </p>

                        </strong>
                        
                        We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require said affiliates to honor this privacy notice. 
                        Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that 
                        are under common control with us.

                </ul>

                <p><strong>HOW WE HANDLE YOUR DATA</strong></p>

                <p>
                    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes described in this privacy notice, unless 
                    a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this 
                    notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time which you have an account with us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we have no ongoing business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or 
                    if this is not possible (for example, because your information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your 
                    personal information and isolate it from any other processing until deletion is possible.
                </p>

                <p><strong>BROWSER CONTROLS AND DO NOT TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>

                <p>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your 
                    privacy preference to not have data about your activities collected. At this stage no standard for recognizing these requests and implementing 
                    modified practices has been finalized. As such we currently choose not to respond to DNT browser signals or any other automated mechanism 
                    that communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for DNT signals is adopted that we are required to follow in the future, 
                    we will inform you about our response in a future privacy notice.
                </p>
